# -Transport-Dashboard-Delivery-Analysis-
 utilizing cloud-based data hosted on MacLeod servers. I analyzed large-scale trip and delivery data, integrated from EFS fuel and maintenance payment systems. Using Power BI, I developed interactive dashboards highlighting key KPIs like revenue per mile, on-time deliveries, and geo-distribution of trips. I also created DAX-driven reports for advanced insights such as cost analysis, delivery performance, and trend forecasting.
